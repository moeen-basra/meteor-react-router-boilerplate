# Meteor 1.3 + React + React Router + Redux Boilerplate

### credit goes to ffxsam

(and sample project)

## Purpose

The goal of this boilerplate is twofold:

1. To provide a good starting point as a scaffold for new Meteor/React projects. This boilerplate will continue to evolve as Meteor and React continue to change and mature.
2. To also serve as a learning resource by offering an example project.

## Installation

Clone this repository, then run:

    $ npm install

This will install NPM packages and update the Meteor packages used in the boilerplate.

## Ideas That Graduated
### `features` folder

I've been using this structure for awhile now, where there's a folder called `features` which contains large parts of a project. For example:

* `features/Billing`
* `features/AnimatedCharts`

These are typically self-contained groups of components, containers, and methods that are not used anywhere else. I've found that this structure makes it much easier for me to track down problems because I know exactly where to look.

## Future Ideas/Plans

* Come up with a totally working and killer test solution using Mocha and Enzyme
* Explore CSS Modules.

If you have any questions, please create an issue in GitHub. Thanks!
